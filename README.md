# notar
was experiment for me. tried to use [meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), [react](https://reactjs.org/), [material-ui](https://mui.com/), [apollo-graphql](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) together and it was perfectly worked in 2016.
### notar's purpose
it was aimed to share universities exams, upload papers, write-answer-edit-reply questions. used [multer](https://github.com/abidinco/file-uploader) for uploading documents.
